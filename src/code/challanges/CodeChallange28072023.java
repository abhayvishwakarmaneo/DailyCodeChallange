//Find maximum profit earned by buying and selling shares any number of times
//        Given a list containing future prediction of share prices, find the maximum profit earned by buying and selling shares any number of times with the constraint, a new transaction can only start after the previous transaction is complete, i.e., we can only hold at most one share at a time.
//        For example:
//        Stock Prices: {1, 5, 2, 3, 7, 6, 4, 5}
//
//        Total profit earned is 10
//
//        Buy on day 1 and sell on day 2
//        Buy on day 3 and sell on day 5
//        Buy on day 7 and sell on day 8
//
//
//        Stock Prices: {10, 8, 6, 5, 4, 2}
//
//        Total profit earned is 0
